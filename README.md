## Overview

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, an NLP-based technique used to classify customer reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The goal is to help large companies like Amazon analyze product reviews efficiently for better decision-making regarding future sales and customer feedback.

Since manually analyzing thousands of reviews is impractical, our tool automates the process, providing businesses with structured insights into customer satisfaction.
